# KVLSTikker-BigScreen
Tikker Bigscreen is an extension for Tikker. 
It provides a 1920 by 1080 pixels screen, which shows real-time statistics.

This project has been merged with the [Tikker repository](https://github.com/Yoronex/KVLSTikker), 
as it has become too integrated with the main project.
